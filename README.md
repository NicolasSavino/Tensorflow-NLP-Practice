A hands-on natural language processing (NLP) project using TensorFlow and Keras. This repository explores text tokenization, sequence padding, sentiment classification, and poetry generation with neural networks. It includes:

Word tokenization and sequence conversion using Keras’ Tokenizer

Text padding and handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens

Binary sentiment analysis on a sarcasm dataset

A simple neural network for text classification

A bidirectional LSTM model for generative poetry

Text generation using n-gram sequences and softmax predictions

Built as part of a practical journey through NLP fundamentals, this code experiments with both basic and advanced TensorFlow techniques—always with a bit of personality in the comments.
